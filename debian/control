Description: interactive processes viewer
 Htop is an ncursed-based process viewer similar to top, but it
 allows one to scroll the list vertically and horizontally to see
 all processes and their full command lines.
 .
 Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
 entering their PIDs.

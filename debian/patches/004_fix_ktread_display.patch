Subject: [PATCH] Disable basename matching for kernel threads

Kernel threads are commonly not based on an executable and their cmdline
therefore just a human readable string.
On Linux this string might contain slashes, e.g. kworker/7:5H-ttm, which
cause Process_writeCommand() to print only the trailing parts if the
option *Show Program Path* is disabled.
